# Esacpe

###### Created for Dr. Chi's MART380 class at the University of South Carolina

A Unity game where you must escape from the world you are currently in.

## Introduction

This is a First-person styled game where you must figure out how to go from world to world.

## Directories

`/Assets` - The Assets Directory to include in a new Unity Project

`/Build` - Prebuilt binaries for Linux, MacOSX, Windows, and WebGL

## Controls

__Mouse__ - Look Around

__Left Mouse Button__ - Shoot a Projectile. The projectile will glow all colors that it can interact with

__WASD__ - Move Around

__SHIFT__ - Run

## How to build

In order to build this project, you should create a New Unity Project, and then import the assets from this assets directory into your project. It should contain all scripts and resources needed to test out the project.

## Motivation

Since this project used a lot of scripts, I felt that it would be good to have this project be open-source to help other students that may take this class in the future see how C# code is written, and how it can be used to make a cool game.

There are scripts to spawn in enemies, keep track of colors, and change the music when the player collects a tessaract, among other things.
